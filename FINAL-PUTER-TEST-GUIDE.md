# üß™ FINAL PUTER.JS MODEL TESTING GUIDE

## Overview
We need to test the following Puter.js models that were specifically requested:
- **DeepSeek**: deepseek, deepseek-chat, deepseek-coder
- **Gemini**: gemini, gemini-pro  
- **Grok**: grok

## Step-by-Step Testing Instructions

### 1. Open the Application
- Go to: http://localhost:3002
- Open Browser Developer Console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)

### 2. Run the Comprehensive Test
```javascript
await testSpecificProviders()
```

This function will:
- Test all the requested provider models
- Show which ones work and which ones fail
- Provide detailed error information
- Categorize results by provider

### 3. Alternative Testing Commands

If the main test doesn't work, try these:

```javascript
// Test all Puter models (broader test)
await testAllPuterModels()

// Authenticate with Puter if needed
await puterAuth()

// Discover what models are actually available
await discoverPuterModels()
```

### 4. Expected Results

**‚úÖ Models likely to work:**
- `deepseek` - Basic DeepSeek model
- `deepseek-chat` - DeepSeek optimized for chat
- `gemini` - Basic Gemini model
- `grok` - Basic Grok model

**‚ùå Models that might fail:**
- `deepseek-coder` - Might require authentication
- `gemini-pro` - Might require authentication

### 5. Interpreting Results

The test will show:
- **Working models**: Added to our model catalog ‚úÖ
- **Failed models**: Need to be removed from catalog ‚ùå
- **Authentication errors**: Models requiring login
- **Network errors**: Connection issues

### 6. Next Steps Based on Results

After testing, we'll:
1. Update `lib/models.ts` to remove failed models
2. Keep only the working models in our catalog
3. Verify the models work in the actual chat interface
4. Document which providers are fully functional

## Current Model Catalog Status

We currently have these models in `lib/models.ts`:
- `puter-deepseek` (DeepSeek via Puter)
- `puter-deepseek-chat` (DeepSeek Chat via Puter)  
- `puter-deepseek-coder` (DeepSeek Coder via Puter)
- `puter-gemini` (Gemini via Puter)
- `puter-gemini-pro` (Gemini Pro via Puter)
- `puter-grok` (Grok via Puter)

**Total: 6 models to verify**
